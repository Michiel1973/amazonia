Letter blocks can be created with the Letter Machine or given with /giveme ehlphabet:(ascii decimal)

Example: `/giveme ehlphabet:65` will give you a block with the letter [**A**] on it.

For UTF-8 characters add one more identifier /giveme ehlphabet:(first byte decimal)_(second byle decimal)

Example: `/giveme ehlphabet:195_132` will give you a block with the letter [**Ã„**] on it.

## Textures

Textures were generated using [**phantomjs**](http://phantomjs.org/download.html) script "gen.js" included in this repository.

To (re)generate textures run:

    $ phantomjs gen.js

To customize the look and size of letters, you need to know basic HTML and CSS and change it inside "gen.js".
