  <li>Keep in mind that even fast parents can procreate a slow child. So you‚Äôll have to breed several times to get an optimal child.</li>
  <li>The method is to breed parents with high speed statistics to get the best descendants, then select the fastest descendants to continue breeding them. This is a very slow process. Be patient.</li>

  <li>You can create a behive with 6 honeycombs and one captured worker bee.</li>
  <li>Player created behives only will have one bee when placed. But you can add more captured bees to a behive (right click) till the limit. Be care: If you put manually a new bee on a behive and the limit is reached, a bee that would be out when come back will die when entering the behive, in order the limit being respected.</li>
  <li>If you put an igniter or a torch below a behive (til 4 nodes), the bees inside will go out.</li>
  <li>You can get Beeswax cooking Honeycombs.</li>
  <li>You can get Beeswax Candles crafting Beewax with a string.</li>
  <li>Trick: Put some flowers surrounding the behive to start the production of honey.</li>
  <li>Trick: Point to a behive to known its statistics about the honey and bees (currently inside).</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: Take into account that if there are flowers close the behive a bee will go to them to collect pollen and inmediatelly will return back to the behive. If you want to see bees flying surrounding the behive, the behive should be full of honey so the bees can go for a walk far away. Also bees remain inside the behive at night.</p>
