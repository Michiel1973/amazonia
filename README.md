# amazonia

This is the main repo for Amazonia, a custom minetest game.

The main focus is survival (not creative mode) and exploration, with a mostly friendly overworld full of life and different biomes where players can build, explore, farm, rear animals, and experiment with the various tech trees, and a very relaxed need to eat occasionally. The first 6000 nodes underground are also harmless, and after that both the monsters and rewards quickly ramp up.

Features a host of mods provided by the awesome Mintest community, licenses and attribution preserved in the various subfolders. Many mods were altered based on what the game intends to accomplish and player feedback, and tuned to work well together and not cause insane server load.

Requires a pretty beefy computer to run well, the current server is a m5a.2xlarge running as EC2 in Amazon's AWS.
